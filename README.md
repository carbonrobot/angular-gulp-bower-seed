# angular-gulp-bower-seed
This is a template used for new angular projects with gulp as the builder and bower as the plugin repo.
The project should be platform agnostic with the exception of LESS being chosen as the pre-processor.
The gitignore file has visual studio references in it since I use Visual Studio as my IDE of choice.
This should not have an effect on anyone using any other IDE.

To use this project, you will at the very least need node.js installed.
Once you extract the project into a folder, open a command prompt at the folder location and run "npm install", then "bower install" without quotes
After that, run the "gulp" command and you're ready to rock.
